In addition, in the 13-week oral toxicity study in rats administered at 50 - 500 mg/kg, no unfavorable effects were observed except a decrease in relative pituitary weight of females in the high dose (HSDB (2009)). Thus, in spite of the classification applicable to "Not classified" in the oral route, the classification for specific target organ toxicity (repeated exposure)　was concluded as "Classification not possible" due to no information available for the other routes (inhalation and dermal exposure).|10-mhlw-0035e.html|||

The acute toxicity of linear and branched AE to algae is in the same range with EC50 values from 0.05 to 50 mg/l. Besides the differences in chemical structure, the reason for the variation may be due to different test conditions and different test species. For the linear types, the toxicity increases with increasing hydrophobe chain length (comparison of C13 EO7-8 and C15 EO7-8, Table 4.8) and decreasing EO chain length (comparison of C12-14 with 4-13 EO, Table 4.8). The toxicity of AE to algae tends to decrease with increasing degree of branching (Table 4.9). Based on the low EC50 values (£ 1 mg/l), the linear AE of C12-15 EO6-8 are considered as very toxic to algae. When the degree of branching is low (£ 25%), the branched types are also considered very toxic to algae. A C12-14 EO9 end-capped with an n-butyl-group was very toxic to a non-specified alga as the EC50 was 0.3 mg/l (Schöberl et al. 1988). <br><br><br>REFERENCE SOURCE: [DANISH EPA]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Bioccumulative: No<br><br><br><br>Rapidly Degradable: ND<br><br>||||

Degeneration of the olfactory epithelium and necrotizing inflammation occurred in the nose of all rats and mice that died and in animals exposed to 50 mg/m3. Necrotizing inflammation was observed in the larynx and trachea of rats and mice at concentrations as low as 5 mg/m3, and a similar lesion was present in the bronchi at exposure concentrations of 50 mg/m3 or higher. Regenerative and inflammatory lesions, including peribronchial and septal fibrosis in the lung, were found in rats and mice exposed to 50 mg/m3. <br><br><br>In 13-week studies, all rats, all female mice, and all but 2 male mice exposed at the top concentration survived to the end of the studies (target exposure concentrations of 0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/m3, 10 animals per group). Rats and mice exposed to 30 mg/m3 lost weight during the first exposure week and then gained weight at the same rate as controls. Lung weights were increased over those of controls in rats exposed at concentrations as low as 1 mg/m3 and in mice exposed to 10 mg/m3 or more. Polycythemia was observed in rats exposed to cobalt sulfate but not in mice. Sperm motility was decreased in mice exposed at 3 mg/m3 or at higher concentrations (lower concentrations were not evaluated), and increased numbers of abnormal sperm were found in mice exposed to 30 mg/m3. Testis and epididymal weights were decreased in mice exposed to 30 mg/m3. Cobalt content in the urine of rats increased with increasing atmospheric cobalt exposure. <br><br><br>Lesions seen in the respiratory tract in 13-week studies in rats and mice included degeneration of the olfactory epithelium, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, and inflammation in the nose; inflammation, necrosis, squamous metaplasia, ulcers (rats), and inflammatory polyps (rats) of the larynx; squamous metaplasia of the trachea (mice); and histiocytic infiltrates, bronchiolar regeneration, peribronchiolar and septal fibrosis, and epithelial hyperplasia in the alveoli of the lung. The most sensitive tissue was the larynx, with squamous metaplasia observed in rats and mice at the lowest exposure concentration of 0.3 mg/m3. Thus, a no-observed-adverse-effect level was not reached in these studies. <br><br><br>Report Date: January 1991<br><br><br>[NTP]<br><br><br>||||

Groups of 10 Wistar rats/sex were head/nose exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 months to methamidophos (SRA 5172, batch # TOX 1767-00, 73.4%) at mean analytical concentrations of 0 (air only), 0 (vehicle), 0 (vehicle, recovery group), 1.1, 5.4, 23.1 (recovery group), or 23.1 mg/m3. After the 3 month exposure period, the two recovery groups (vehicle and 23.1 mg/m3) were allowed a 6-week exposure -free period. Treatment-related effects were seen in both sexes at 23.1 mg/m3: slight to moderate tremors on the day of exposure but not prior to exposure the next day; decreased body weight gain, decreased relative spleen weights and increased relative adrenal weights. There were treatment-related, noncumulative decreases in cholinesterase activity in plasma and brain, and increased sensitivity to the acetylcholine provocation test in both sexes at 5.4 and 23.1 mg/m3. The NOEL = 1.1 mg/m3 (• 0.3 mg/kg body weight/day) based on decreases in brain cholinesterase ant the mid and high doses and tremors at the high dose. No adverse effect was indicated.

In rats, increased incidences of fibrosarcoma in the spleen, osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma, sarcoma N.O.S, fibroma and pheochromocytoma in the adrenal gland were observed in both sexes, and the carcinogenicity of p-chloronitrobenzene in F344/DuCrj (Fischer) rats was indicated. In mice, increased incidences of hemangioma, malignant lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma were observed in the males, and increased incidences of angiosarcoma in the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma were observed in females. However, it is not possible to conclude that p-chloronitrobenzene is carcinogenic in Crj:BDF1 mice due to the low incidences (Results from Carcinogenicity Studies (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) (1991)). Based on the data, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has made a public announcement on guidelines in order to prevent the impairment of worker's health based on Industrial Safety and Health Act Article 28-3 (2006).
